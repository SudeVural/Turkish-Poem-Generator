# Turkish Poem Generator
 A poem generator that uses an N-gram language model.  

The generator is still incomplete. Our models mostly work but they do not meet our initial goals.
Bigram model is complete. However, since it is a bigram model it is rather meaningless for a poem. Though, this is what we have expected at the beginning.
We implemented a different function for the first verses that takes an input as the seed word.

We have some ideas that we did not yet have a chance to code. We want to limit which words can occur at the end of a line by implementing a code (probably with start and end tokens). And we would like to add a rhyme generator.
