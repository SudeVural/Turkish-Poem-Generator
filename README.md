# Turkish Poem Generator
 A poem generator that uses an N-gram language model.  
 
 We implemented bigram and trigram models; however, they are completely separate models. We just wanted to see how different outputs they would generate.
 Bigram model is more random and meaningless as we have predicted. We included ngram counts and the frequency distributions as extras.
 
The program takes two inputs: one for the structure (e.g. 1 x 3, 2 x 4) and the other for the starting word. Note that this start word begins the poem and it doesn't have any impact on the rest of the poem.
